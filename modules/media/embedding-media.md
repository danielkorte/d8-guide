# Embedding media items

By default the media module provides embedding functionality for all text format with a wysiwyg editor. Go to node\/add and click on any type. In the text editor, an icon for media embed should now be visible. Refer to the below image if you aren't able to find the icon:

In the modal which now opens, select the media item and click on 'Select media' button.

In the next modal, choose the appropriate value for 'Display as' field \(Choose 'media library' if you are unsure\) and click on embed.
